# About

DPoS Vote DApp is a voting application which allows users to take part in powering the Elastos network. Along with merge-mining bitcoin, there's an extra layer of validation called Delegated Proof of Stake composed of Elastos Supernodes. These Supernodes help validate an ELA block once it is mined using bitcoin's hashrate. It's used as an extra layer of security ontop of bitcoin's proof of work algorithim, making it near impossible to infiltrate the Elastos network. A user of this app can help vote for the most trusted and reliable Supernodes, giving them the chance to not only help direct the power of the Elastos network, but to also get a share of the ELA rewards received by the Supernodes they vote for. 

# How it works

In order for a user to vote for the Supernodes listed in the DPoS Vote DApp, they will need to aquire ELA. The Elastos DPoS system allows a user to vote for up to 36 Supernodes despite their balance. However, the more ELA one owns, the more rewards they will receive
